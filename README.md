# Scrap-Analysis-Public

This is a version of my code created to generate a monthly report of scrapped material generated by the Hutchinson Aeorspace and Industry plant in Hopkinton MA. Each month data can be pulled from our ERP system, loaded into this program and will output overall plant data as well as a breakdown by department. 

This information can then be used by department managers and Manufacturing Engineers to identify areas for improvement.
